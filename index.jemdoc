== About me
I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, advised by Dr. Peng Gao.\n
I got the M.S. degree in Chemistry from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in 2022. I received the B.S. degree in Chemical Science from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech).

== Research
My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and AI for science.\n
Specifically, I focus on leveraging machine learning to address fundamental challenges in materials science and chemistry. My work involves developing AI/ML models guided by fundamental scientific principles to enhance property prediction, accelerate the design and discovery of novel materials and small molecules.
